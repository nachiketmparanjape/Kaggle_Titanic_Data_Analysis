# Survival on the Titanic

This repo contains a Jupyter notebook with qualitative data analysis and visualization of the data available from the Titanic disaster.

## We try to find basic information such as -
1.) Who were the passengers on the Titanic? (Ages,Gender,Class,..etc)

2.) What deck were the passengers on and how does that relate to their class?

3.) Where did the passengers come from?

4.) Who was alone and who was with family?


## Then we try to dig a little deeper - what factors saved someone from sinking?
1.) Class

2.) Gender

3.) Age

4.) Deck

5.) Presence / Absence of company

6.) Combined effects of all these factors


## Finally, several predictive algorithms are run on the data to identify the most effective feature and train the features to optimize the model performance.
